	-	Allow user to insert coins into a vending machine;
	-	Once the product is selected and the appropriate amount of coins inserted - it should return the product;
	-	It should return change (coins) if inserted too much;
	-	Change should be returned with the minimum amount of coins possible;
	-	It should notify the customer when the selected product is out of stock;

## Self test case 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
VM is initialised with default following set of coins (see table above)

You want to buy Coca Cola (2$)
You have entered 60.50$ 
On your balance is 58.50$
You press to get the change
And machine will dispense 
5 x 5$ => 25
5 x 3$ => 15
5 x 2$ => 10
5 x 1$ => 5
5 x .5$ => 2.5
4 x .25 => 1

Only 1 x 0.25 is left on VM balance 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Self test case 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
VM is initialised with default following set of coins (see table above)

You want to buy Coca Cola (2$)
You have entered 100$ 
On your balance is 98$
You press to get the change
And machine will dispense 
5 x 5$ => 25
5 x 3$ => 15
5 x 2$ => 10
5 x 1$ => 5
5 x 0.5$ => 2.5
5 x 0.25 => 1

VM balance is equal 0$
Your balance is 39.25$
And you can buy something else but without possibility to return change change
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Self test case 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After some transactions
there are available only some of coins on VM:
1 x 5$
1 x 3$
5 x 2$
0 x 1$
5 x .5$
5 x .25$
On your balance is 9$

You want to receive the change.
VM returns you:
1 x 5$, 2 x 2$.  (3 coins)

1 x 5$, 1 x 3$, 2 x .5$ is incorrect (4 coins)
1 x 5$, 1 x 3$, 4 x .25$ is incorrect (6 coins)
Etc.
